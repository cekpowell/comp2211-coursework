TODO:
    - !!!!Double check runway calculations!!!!
    - Runway revision for takeoff away from obstacle when it is past TORA but within ASDA and TODA. (lannding towards obstacle and take off towards obstacle)
    - Round revision parameters so that really long values are not displayed.
    - Case where runway parameters go negative - should display them as 0 and not as negatives/

for example, with runway parameters, focus not on how they are presented, but that they are shown to you, as we have
focussed only on the main program logic, and not UI display.

we wanted to focus on main program logic, but still give the user a way to use the system for runway revisions.
